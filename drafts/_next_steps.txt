Indeed, your App.jsx file is quite long and contains a lot of logic. Here are some suggestions to refactor it:

Move the handlers to custom hooks: You can create custom hooks for handling blog articles. For example, you can create a useBlogArticles hook that handles fetching, adding, deleting, and updating blog articles. This hook would return the blog articles and the handler functions, which you can then use in your App component.

Move the form to a separate component: You can create a BlogArticleForm component that handles the form inputs and validation. This component would take the handler functions from the useBlogArticles hook as props and call them when necessary.

Move the constants to a separate file: You can create a constants.js file and move all your constants there. This will make your App.jsx file shorter and easier to read.

Split the rendering into smaller components: Your App component is responsible for rendering many different parts of the page. You can create smaller components for each part, such as Header, Footer, BlogArticleList, AdminModeEntry, UserModeEntry, etc. This will make your App component much cleaner and easier to understand.

Use async/await syntax: Instead of using .then and .catch, you can use async/await syntax in your useEffect hooks. This will make your code cleaner and easier to read.

Error handling: Consider creating a custom hook or a higher-order component for error handling. This will help to keep your main component clean and focused on its main purpose.

Remember, the goal of refactoring is to make the code cleaner and easier to understand, not necessarily shorter. It's okay if some of your components are long, as long as they are easy to understand and maintain.

Splitting your CSS into separate files can be a good idea for maintaining a clean and organized codebase. Here's how you can do it:

Component-specific CSS: Create a separate CSS file for each component. For example, you can have Header.css, Footer.css, BlogArticleForm.css, etc. Each of these files would contain the styles specific to that component.

Common CSS: Keep a Common.css or Base.css file for styles that are used across multiple components. This can include your root variables, general styles, and any utility classes.

Layout CSS: If you have styles that are specific to the layout of your page (like grid or flexbox styles), you can keep them in a separate Layout.css file.

Remember to import the relevant CSS file in each of your components. For example, in your Header.jsx file, you would import Header.css.

This approach can make your CSS easier to manage and debug, as it's clear which styles apply to which components. It also makes it easier to reuse styles across different components.
